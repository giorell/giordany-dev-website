    <title>About</title>
    My main passion is to create. Born and raised in LA, I grew up drawing
    anything and everything, whether its Batman or Boba Fett, or Transformers
    and G.I. Joes, I loved seeing my creations come to life right in front of
    me. I drew alot, created comic books, and even wrote short stories.
    Eventually I landed on filmmaking and fell in love with story telling. I
    attended the University of Southern California on a full scholarship and was
    fortunate enough to get accepted into the School of Cinematic Arts. In 2009,
    I graduated and created my own production company called Anchorbolt Studios.
    I ran it for 5 years with my good friends Mario Reyes and Rocky Collins. We
    produced films, commercials, music vidoes, and online content. Here is our
    trailer: After writing directing and editing my first feature film, The
    Grotto, I decided I no longer wanted to make films. I loved storytelling but
    the process of making a film was too limiting and the journey too taxing.
    Some love the journey of film creation, but I realized the journey was not
    for me. I decided I wanted to be involved more in the technological future
    of society and landed on programming. In many ways, creating a movie and
    creating an app are very similiar, both require a connection with the
    audience/user and both require a compelling story.
